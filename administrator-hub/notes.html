          Welcome to the Z Laboratories computer system!
          Congratulations on your position of System Administrator.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our network is equipped with state-of-the-art hardware. Its smooth
          operation is ensured by advanced automated control software.
          Should a problem arise, the Direct Connect (TM) protocol developed
          by our engineers would help you to troubleshoot it without leaving
          you workstation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your responsibilities include monitoring the state of the network and
          addressing potential issues before they adversely affect research
          workstations and data storage and retrieval systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          During your probation period, we expect you to fully familiarize
          yourself with the network structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your starting point should be <strong>feef.0000</strong>, which contains an up-to-date
          listing of main hubs and data stations, as well as notes left by previous system administators.
          Use the <strong>Connect</strong> tool available in the <strong>Administrator Hub</strong>
          to reach it.
